[length: 04:05]
[00:18.61]Had to let go of who I thought I should be to find who I am
[00:21.59]Don't mean the edited one for the 'Gram
[00:23.32]But I mean the one who needs love, has fear and doubt
[00:25.79]And only comes out around fam
[00:27.15]See, I'm just a man, I bleed and it's red
[00:29.02]Been tryin' to quiet the voice in my head
[00:30.92]Too weak to repeat all the things that it says
[00:32.83]You're destined to slip when you live on the edge
[00:34.69]And I'm doin' my best, but it's never enough
[00:36.77]It's always, "Hey, when you gon' follow this up?"
[00:38.65]I give 'em so much of myself, my art, my soul
[00:40.95]There isn't much left in my cup
[00:42.31]Not prayin' enough, don't know who to trust
[00:44.26]Don't follow for follow, I follow my gut
[00:46.21]There is no more room for discourse anymore
[00:47.88]It's: "I'm right and you're wrong, and agree or shut up"
[00:50.07]What in the fuck? When will we learn?
[00:51.98]Together we grow, and divided we burn
[00:53.75]There's over seven billion of us on Earth
[00:55.68]And here I am talkin' 'bout puttin' me first
[00:57.52]And all of my hurt, like anyone cares
[00:59.65]I have a tendency to overshare
[01:01.46]Crazy to look at a sea full of people
[01:03.21]And still feel like there isn't anyone there
[01:05.15]As everyone stares, I swear that I'm fine
[01:07.25]Tears streamin' outta both of my eyes
[01:09.13]They love to see all this raw and real emotion
[01:11.38]So they can upload it online
[01:12.84]This story is mine, they took and rewrote it
[01:14.80]They'll do anything for a click and they post it
[01:16.52]But never with credit, my art has been lessened to trends
[01:18.94]While people pretend like they own it
[01:20.39]Okay, duly noted, things change in due time
[01:22.45]Things that I wanted all losin' their shine
[01:24.44]Now all I want is to text, or to talk to my dad
[01:26.53]But know I'll never get a reply
[01:28.08]And that weighs on my mind, not tryin' to harp
[01:30.15]But I have to live with this hole in my heart
[01:31.95]And maybe the only real way that I know how to cope
[01:34.18]Is by losin' myself in the art
[01:35.53]I said things that were harsh and I never meant
[01:37.61]I let discontent really mess with my head
[01:39.61]So many things that I wish I had done and had said
[01:41.65]Before I never saw him again
[01:43.17]Time that I make amends and pull back the curtain
[01:45.23]I barely was there, even when he was hurtin'
[01:47.13]And I think of that, I think, "Damn, what a terrible son"
[01:49.44]And I question myself as a person
[01:50.81]A human still learnin'
[01:53.08]Huh
[01:54.62]Just a human still learnin' (uh-uh)
[01:58.43]Know I'll never be perfect
[02:02.14]That's the only thing certain, yeah
[02:06.38]Someone mentioned the music was savin' their life, they relate to it so much it hurts
[02:10.35]And I thought to myself, "I'm so glad I could help, but it's you who put in all the work"
[02:14.20]So don't give me credit 'cause I'm just a human who loses himself in his words
[02:18.15]I wonder if Steve ever thought that one day we'd be treatin' an app like a church
[02:21.99]And hold up these content creators and athletes and artists as if they were gods
[02:25.77]Until we decide they no longer have value, then they're thrown away and forgot
[02:29.48]See, honestly, all that we are is a sum of our vices, our fears, and our flaws
[02:32.28]And then at the end, we end up in a box and can't bring anything that we bought
[02:36.50]All the things that we're not make us who we are
[02:38.64]Nobody thought I would make it this far
[02:40.48]Used to shoot for the sky 'til I realized that it had been proven
[02:42.67]That humans are made out of stars
[02:44.27]I spill out my heart, it's all that I know
[02:46.22]Never been good at just lettin' shit go
[02:47.94]Do you know how it feels to sink all that you have in your craft
[02:50.33]And still feel like there's nothin' to show?
[02:51.97]This here is a poem, a letter, a song
[02:53.82]I don't know where in the fuck I belong
[02:55.65]There's nothin' more lonely than bein' surrounded by people
[02:57.99]Yet all of your people are wrong
[02:59.44]I feel like a pawn, I feel like I'm trapped
[03:01.49]There's people I miss I can never get back
[03:03.25]But been learnin' that life's not about how much water we have
[03:05.67]It's about how we look at the glass, that's a lot to unpack, yeah
[03:09.72]Dan said, "Jump on a track, give 'em all that you have," yeah
[03:13.69]Ever since, I don't know what it's like to hold back, yeah
[03:17.47]When the story's authentic, you don't need to act, yeah
[03:20.29]Never needed to act, yeah
[03:21.81]There's concepts I need to explore, and feelings I can't just ignore
[03:24.71]Who cares what you do, who you doin' it for?
[03:26.62]Oh, my, how the tables have turned
[03:28.10]Since I used to serve food that I couldn't afford
[03:29.77]Mom and Dad got divorced, Mom just got remarried
[03:31.73]For most of my life thought commitment was scary
[03:33.73]But now I don't know, some places you can't take a road
[03:36.25]If you don't like the story, you should write your...
[03:39.61]Own
[03:40.71]
